        "We've seen in previous chapters how powerful [retrieval augmentation](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langchain-retrieval-augmentation/) and [conversational agents](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langchain-agents/) can be. They become even more impressive when we begin using them together.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conversational agents can struggle with data freshness, knowledge about specific domains, or accessing internal documentation. By coupling agents with retrieval augmentation tools we no longer have these problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "One the other side, using \"naive\" retrieval augmentation without the use of an agent means we will retrieve contexts with *every* query. Again, this isn't always ideal as not every query requires access to external knowledge.\n",

        "Merging these methods gives us the best of both worlds. In this notebook we'll learn how to do this.\n",

By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to a system of electives. Their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School for that reason. Notre Dame continued to grow over the years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a professional law school.

The university has many multi-disciplinary institutes devoted to research in varying fields, including the Medieval Institute, the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the Kroc Institute for International Peace studies, and the Center for Social Concerns. Recent research includes work on family conflict and child development, genome mapping, the increasing trade deficit of the United States with China, studies in fluid mechanics, computational science and engineering, and marketing trends on the Internet. In 2014 the Notre Dame student body consisted of 12,179 students, with 8,448 undergraduates, 2,138 graduate and professional and 1,593 professional (Law, M.Div., Business, M.Ed.) students. The university's intramural sports program was named in 2004 by Sports Illustrated as the best program in the country, while in 2007 The Princeton Review named it as the top school where \\\"Everyone Plays Intramural Sports.\\\"\"\n",
